# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive user hierarchy system with reference code-based recruitment and role-based permissions. The system supports 5 distinct user roles (Super Agent, Agent, Client, Super Worker, Worker) with hierarchical relationships, reference code assignment for user recruitment, and role-specific dashboard functionality with appropriate permission controls.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Role Hierarchy System

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a hierarchical user role structure with 5 distinct roles, so that I can manage different levels of users with appropriate permissions and relationships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN users are created THEN they SHALL be assigned to one of these 5 roles
3. WHEN role hierarchy is established THEN Super Agent SHALL be at the top level with full system access
4. WHEN role relationships are defined THEN Agents SHALL be sub-users under Super Agents
5. WHEN role relationships are defined THEN Workers SHALL be sub-users under Super Workers
6. WHEN role relationships are defined THEN Clients SHALL be assigned to Agents or Super Agents
7. WHEN user roles are assigned THEN the system SHALL enforce hierarchical relationships in all operations

### Requirement 2: Reference Code Assignment System

**User Story:** As a Super Agent, Agent, or Super Worker, I want to have reference codes for recruiting users, so that I can build my network and track user assignments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN Super Agent reference codes are generated THEN one SHALL be for recruiting Agents and one SHALL be for recruiting Clients
3. WHEN an Agent account is created THEN the system SHALL generate 1 unique reference code for recruiting Clients
4. WHEN a Super Worker account is created THEN the system SHALL generate 1 unique reference code for recruiting Workers
5. WHEN reference codes are generated THEN they SHALL be unique across the entire system
6. WHEN reference codes are created THEN they SHALL be stored in the database with owner identification
7. WHEN reference codes are displayed THEN users SHALL be able to view and share their codes

### Requirement 3: Registration with Reference Code Validation

**User Story:** As a new user registering for the system, I want to enter a reference code during registration, so that I can be automatically assigned to the appropriate network hierarchy.

1. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL require a reference code as a mandatory field
2. WHEN a reference code is entered THEN the system SHALL validate it exists in the database
3. WHEN reference code validation occurs THEN the system SHALL identify the code owner (Super Agent/Agent/Super Worker)
4. WHEN a valid reference code is provided THEN the user SHALL be automatically assigned to the code owner's network
5. WHEN user assignment occurs THEN all relationships SHALL ultimately roll up to the Super Agent level
6. WHEN an invalid reference code is entered THEN the system SHALL display an error message and prevent registration
7. WHEN registration is completed THEN the user SHALL be granted appropriate permissions based on their assigned role

### Requirement 4: Database Schema Updates for Hierarchy

**User Story:** As a system developer, I want updated database schemas to support the user hierarchy and reference tracking, so that all relationships and assignments are properly stored.

6. WHEN I attempt to modify project status THEN the system SHALL prevent me from making changes
7. WHEN clients view pricing THEN it SHALL be based on my word count settings
8. WHEN pricing calculator is used THEN it SHALL update dynamically based on project word count

### Requirement 7: Super Worker Dashboard with Assignment Control

**User Story:** As a Super Worker, I want to assign projects to sub-workers and manage their assignments, so that I can distribute workload effectively while maintaining standard rates.
