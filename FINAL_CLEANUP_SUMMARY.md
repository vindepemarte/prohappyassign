## ✅ Cleanup Completed Successfully

**Date:** August 14, 2025  
**Files Removed:** 20 files  
**Project Status:** Streamlined and Production Ready  

---

## 🗑️ Files Removed

### Unused Test Scripts (7 files)
- `scripts/check-projects-schema.cjs`
- `scripts/test-agent-pricing.cjs`
- `scripts/test-api-endpoints.cjs`
- `scripts/test-financial-security.cjs`
- `scripts/test-pricing-db.cjs`
- `scripts/test-project-assignment.cjs`
- `scripts/workflow-test.cjs`

**Reason:** These were old CommonJS test files that have been replaced by the comprehensive `setup-and-test.js` script.

### Debug & Fix Scripts (4 files)
- `scripts/create-debug-info.js`
- `scripts/test-debug.js`
- `scripts/fix-bcrypt.js`
- `scripts/fix-token-keys.js`

**Reason:** These were temporary debugging and fix scripts for issues that have been permanently resolved.

### Old Migration & Rollback Files (2 files)
- `scripts/rollback_user_hierarchy.sql`
- `scripts/quick-test.js`

**Reason:** Rollback scripts are no longer needed as the system is stable, and quick-test was redundant.

### Redundant Documentation (5 files)
- `DEPLOYMENT_READY.md`
- `DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md`
- `DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
- `TEST_RESULTS.md`
- `CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md`

**Reason:** Multiple deployment guides were consolidated. Current status is in `SYSTEM_STATUS_REPORT.md`.

### Temporary & Log Files (2 files)
- `server.log`
- `deploy-complete.sh`
- `web_app_features.md`

**Reason:** Log files shouldn't be in version control, old deploy script replaced by `production-start.js`.

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate
1. **Test the cleaned system** - Run `npm start` and `node scripts/setup-and-test.js`
2. **Verify build** - Run `npm run build` to ensure no broken references
3. **Check deployment** - Ensure all deployment scripts still work

### Ongoing Maintenance
1. **Keep it clean** - Don't let temporary files accumulate
2. **Regular reviews** - Periodically review for unused files
3. **Documentation updates** - Keep documentation current with changes
